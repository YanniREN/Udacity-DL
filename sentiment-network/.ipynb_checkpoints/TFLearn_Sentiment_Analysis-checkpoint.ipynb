    "# Sentiment analysis with TFLearn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll continue Andrew Trask's work by building a network for sentiment analysis on the movie review data. Instead of a network written with Numpy, we'll be using [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/), a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow. TFLearn makes it simpler to build networks just by defining the layers. It takes care of most of the details for you.\n",

    "Following along with Andrew, our goal here is to convert our reviews into word vectors. The word vectors will have elements representing words in the total vocabulary. If the second position represents the word 'the', for each review we'll count up the number of times 'the' appears in the text and set the second position to that count. I'll show you examples as we build the input data from the reviews data. Check out Andrew's notebook and video for more about this."

The data we're using has already been preprocessed a bit and we know it uses only lower case characters. If we were working from raw data, where we didn't know it was all lower case, we would want to add a step here to convert it. That's so we treat different variations of the same word, like `The`, `the`, and `THE`, all the same way."

    "### Counting word frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off we'll need to count how often each word appears in the data. We'll use this count to create a vocabulary we'll use to encode the review data. This resulting count is known as a [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model). We'll use it to select our vocabulary and build the word vectors. You should have seen how to do this in Andrew's lesson. Try to implement it here using the [Counter class](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise:** Create the bag of words from the reviews data and assign it to `total_counts`. The reviews are stores in the `reviews` [Pandas DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html). If you want the reviews as a Numpy array, use `reviews.values`. You can iterate through the rows in the DataFrame with `for idx, row in reviews.iterrows():` ([documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html)). When you break up the reviews into words, use `.split(' ')` instead of `.split()` so your results match ours."

    "[TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) lets you build the network by [defining the layers](http://tflearn.org/layers/core/). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input layer\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input layer, you just need to tell it how many units you have. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.input_data([None, 100])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would create a network with 100 input units. The first element in the list, `None` in this case, sets the batch size. Setting it to `None` here leaves it at the default batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of inputs to your network needs to match the size of your data. For this example, we're using 10000 element long vectors to encode our input data, so we need 10000 input units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding layers\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new hidden layers, you use \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, n_units, activation='ReLU')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds a fully connected layer where every unit in the previous layer is connected to every unit in this layer. The first argument `net` is the network you created in the `tflearn.input_data` call. It's telling the network to use the output of the previous layer as the input to this layer. You can set the number of units in the layer with `n_units`, and set the activation function with the `activation` keyword. You can keep adding layers to your network by repeated calling `net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, n_units)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The last layer you add is used as the output layer. Therefore, you need to set the number of units to match the target data. In this case we are predicting two classes, positive or negative sentiment. You also need to set the activation function so it's appropriate for your model. Again, we're trying to predict if some input data belongs to one of two classes, so we should use softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 2, activation='softmax')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "To set how you train the network, use \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='sgd', learning_rate=0.1, loss='categorical_crossentropy')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is passing in the network you've been building. The keywords: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `optimizer` sets the training method, here stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "* `learning_rate` is the learning rate\n",
    "* `loss` determines how the network error is calculated. In this example, with the categorical cross-entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you put all this together to create the model with `tflearn.DNN(net)`. So it ends up looking something like \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.input_data([None, 10])                          # Input\n",
    "net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 5, activation='ReLU')      # Hidden\n",
